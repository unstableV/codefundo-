<h1><b>Prediction</b></h1>

<h2><b>Process</b></h2>

Daily satellites used to take pictures  of earth tropology,so we have large amount dataset of the earth .We will
Develop an model which will take input these photographs and see the changes by comparisons. We will create an algorithm which will calculate the moments between the earth(compare the previous photo with current photo). We will set a threshold value . If the calculated value increase above the threshold value then there is chance of Earthquake.

•	We are going to use AI for predicting the earthquakes
•	AI techniques such as image recognition and classification can be quite helpful in assessing the damage as they can analyze and observe images from the satellites.
•	Using tensor flow  dependency we will create optimise model for efficient results.
•	By using big data and cloud computing to predict the natural disasters

<h2><b>How to alert people</b></h2>

•	We are going to create the chatbot
•	When the prediction is conformed chatbot will start sending message to danger arear people and giving them instructions.
•	People can also ask for help to these chatbots and these chatbot will give them most accurate solution.

<h2><b>Chatbot technology</b></h2>

We are going to use Microsoft bot framework for the creation of the bot.
We will train them with datasets.

<h2><b>Manage the impact of earthquake</b></h2>

We will  recognize buildings on satellite photos by learning from the crowd. We will create the AI model which will tell us who wants the urgent help .We  will compare the buildings the most damage buildings people needed the urgent help so our model will give us the most optimize location.
Our model will also manage the food and other medicine things so that it will be distributed efficiently.

AI bots are always there for helping and update the information among the people.

<h1><b<i>We will create an application using all the above functionality and technologies so that we can able to save more people and reduce the damage by earthquake.</i></b></h1>
